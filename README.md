# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview :

This analysis looks at the different types of cryptocurrencies and how they should be grouped towards creating a classification. 


## Results

The analysis was done by undertaking below 4 tasks:

* **Data Preprocesing to prepare for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means**

* **Visualizing Results to create plots and data lables**

  * A 3D-Scatter plot is created using Plotly Express to plot the clusters.
hvplot.table is used to create a data table with all the current tradable cryptocurrencies.

  * A scatter plot is created using hvplot.scatter, to present the clustered data about cryptocurrencies having x="TotalCoinsMined" and y="TotalCoinSupply" to contrast the number of available coins versus the total number of mined coins.
